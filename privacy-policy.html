            The following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR based on
            which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
            provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may
            apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore,
            should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we
            will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

            Contractual performance and pre-contractual requests (Art. 6 (1) p.
            1 lit. b) DSGVO)
          </h4>
          <p>
            Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
            the data subject is a party or for the performance of
            pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.-
            Registered interests (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO) - Processing is
            necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third
            party unless such interests are overridden by the interests or
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
            the protection of personal data.In addition to the data protection
            regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national
            regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in
            particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in
            Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular,
            the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information,
            the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special
            categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and
            transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual
            cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data
            processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular
            concerning the establishment, implementation, or termination of
            employment relationships as well as the consent of employees.
            Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal
            states may apply.
          </p>
          <h4>Face Data Collection and Usage for Identity Verification</h4>
          <p>
            In our commitment to uphold the highest standards of user privacy
            and data security, we meticulously delineate our practices regarding
            the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of facial data
            obtained for identity verification purposes. Our application employs
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) Recognition for the sole purpose of
            identity verification, a process which necessitates a photograph of
            the user's face. Please be assured that this process is designed to
            respect user privacy in the following manner:<br />‍<br />Data
            Collection: Our application does not collect or store face data
            within its own systems. When a user submits a photo for identity
            verification, this photo is transmitted directly to AWS Recognition
            without any duplication or retention on our end.<br /><br />Data
            Usage: The photo provided by the user is exclusively used for the
            intended function of verifying the identity of the individual. We do
            not exploit this photo for any ancillary purposes, nor do we extract
            any additional data from this process.<br /><br />Data Disclosure:
            There is a firm policy against sharing the submitted photo or any
            facial data derived from it with third parties. The integrity of our
            users' personal data is paramount, and as such, we ensure there are
            stringent controls against unauthorized disclosure.<br /><br />Data
            Retention: We adhere to a strict policy of not retaining face data
            after the verification process. Once the photograph is forwarded to
            AWS Recognition and the necessary verification is complete, we
            ensure that the photo is not saved, stored, or otherwise retained in
            any of our systems or on any external storage devices.<br /><br />Data
            Security: We employ robust security measures to safeguard the
            transmission of the photo to AWS Recognition, ensuring the data is
            encrypted in transit and handled with the utmost care.
          </p>
          <h4>Security measures</h4>
          <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures by the
            legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the
            implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and
            purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities
            of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and
            freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of protection
            appropriate to the risk.The measures include, in particular,
            safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
            data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as
            well as access to, the input of, disclosure of, assurance of
            availability of, and segregation of the data. Furthermore, we have
            established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects'
            rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise.
            Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into
            account during the development or selection of hardware, and
            software as well as procedures following the principle of data
            protection, through technology design and data protection-friendly
            default settings.TLS encryption (https): To protect your data
            transmitted via our online offer, we use TLS encryption. You can
            recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the
            address bar of your browser.
          </p>
          <h4>Transmission of personal data</h4>
          <p>
            In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that
            the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies,
            legally independent organizational units or persons. The recipients
            of this data may include, for example, service providers
            commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that
            are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the
            legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate
            contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the
            recipients of your data. Data processing in third countriesIf we
            process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union
            (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes
            place in the context of the use of third-party services or the
            disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or
            companies, this is only done following the legal
            requirements.Subject to express consent or contractually or legally
            required transfer, we only process or allow the processing of data
            in third countries with a recognized level of data protection,
            contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses
            of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding
            internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO,
            information page of the EU Commission:
            https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de).
          </p>
          <h4>Data deletion</h4>
          <p>
            The data processed by us will be deleted following the legal
            requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are
            revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of
            processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not required for
            the purpose). If the data are not deleted because they are required
            for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be
            limited to these purposes. That is, the data is blocked and not
            processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data
            that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose
            storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of
            legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural
            or legal person.Our data protection notices may also contain further
            details on the retention and deletion of data, which have priority
            for the respective processing operations.<br /><br />Provision of

            files". The server log files may include the address and name of the
            web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volumes
            transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and
            version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously
            visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting
            provider. The server log files may be used, on the one hand, for
            security purposes, e.g., to prevent server overload (especially in
            the event of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the
            other hand, to ensure the utilization of the servers and their
            stability; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1
            lit. f) DSGVO); Deletion of data: Log file information is stored for
            a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose
            further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from
            deletion until final clarification of the respective incident.
